## About the project
This is default React app created with "create-react-app" command.
Feel free to use all its commands like 

`npm build`

`npm start`

etc.

## Testing functionality

You need to create a _.env_ file with link for server.
For me the _.env_ file looks like this:

REACT_APP_API_URI=http://localhost:3001/api/

## Start

Just install deps

`npm i`

and run

`npm start`

to start.
